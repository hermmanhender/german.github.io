Hi everyone! I am currently working on my PhD thesis. Among the main interests for the development of my research are bioclimatic strategies in dwelling, 
the comfort of the inhabitants, energy storage and generation from Renewable Energy Sources. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence is a 
research interest that I will use to enable the development of an energy and comfort management model in dwelling.
