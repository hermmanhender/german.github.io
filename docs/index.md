Electromechanical Engineer with a solid background in Sustainable Development 
of Human Habitat and a passion for innovation in the field of intelligent 
building automation, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Currently, I am 
immersed in the doctoral phase, actively collaborating with the Cliope Group 
and Dahrma on cutting-edge projects that seek to revolutionize the way we 
interact with the built environment and energy resources.

Throughout my career, I have accumulated extensive experience in integrating 
technologies to optimize the performance of buildings, reduce their 
environmental footprint and improve the quality of life of their occupants. 
My research focuses on the development of innovative solutions that merge 
intelligent automation with renewable energy sources, paving the way 
towards a more sustainable and efficient future.

My commitment to excellence has led me to collaborate on various 
multidisciplinary projects and publish my results at academic meetings 
or in specialized journals. I am excited to contribute to the advancement 
of the industry, whether through research, consulting or creating practical 
and sustainable solutions.

My vision is to drive the adoption of more sustainable practices in building 
design and management, and work closely with teams passionate about 
sustainability and energy efficiency. I am always open to new opportunities 
and connections that share this vision and that allow us to build a greener 
and more livable world.

Feel free to contact me for collaborations, research opportunities, or just 
to connect and share ideas! Together, we can make a significant difference 
in the way we live and work in harmony with our environment.
